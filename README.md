This repository demonstrates two uncommon bugs related to the CSS `calc()` function. The first bug showcases a calculation order problem where the parent element's width needs to be fully determined before the child's width, calculated using `calc()`, can be accurately computed.  The second bug highlights the issue of using incompatible units within a `calc()` expression. Solutions are provided to address these issues.  Read the comments within the code for more details.
