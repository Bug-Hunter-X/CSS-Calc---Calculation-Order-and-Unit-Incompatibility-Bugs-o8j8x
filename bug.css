The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly. For example, if we try to use `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a `width` property of an element that's a child of another element with a defined `width`, it might not work as expected if the parent element's width is not fully defined or calculated before the child's width is. This happens because `calc()` needs the parent's width to calculate the child's width, creating a calculation order issue.  Another example is using `calc()` with units that aren't compatible (e.g., `calc(100px + 10%)`).
